# MacRuby Canvas

MacRuby Canvas is intended to get the excellent HotCocoa Graphics/MacRuby Graphics back up and working again with OS X Lion. The focus is on static image generation.

See [HotCocoa Graphics by drtoast](http://hcg.drtoast.com)

# Design Goals

- Harness the full power of Quartz and Core Image
- Make it as independent of other libraries as possible
- Keep it light and maintainable and maintain it running from OS X Lion upwards

# Heritage
 
Inspiration for this project was derived from Processing and NodeBox.  These excellent graphics programming environments are more full-featured than MRG, but they are implemented in Java and Python, respectively.  MRG was created to offer similar functionality using the Ruby programming language.

The original author of this library is James Reynolds, MacRuby Graphics was then called Ruby Cocoa Graphics and was packaged as part of Hotcocoa. I made the choice to extract it, add more examples and specs so MacRuby developers could use this library as an addon to their projects without needing HotCocoa.
